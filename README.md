Student Performance Analysis
============================
This is a study on a [Student Performance Data Set][Dataset] based on two 
Portuguese schools students information.

If you wish a more detail explanation of what were the Machine Learning 
Strategies used, how, and which conclusions were reached you may read the
 [research paper][Research Paper].

Original Research & Motivation
------------------------------
This technical analysis was based on a [portuguese research][Original Paper], 
but with a focus on Machine Learning instead of Business Intelligence.

Dataset
-------
The dataset along a description of the attributes can be downloaded at the 
[UCI Machine Learning Repository][Dataset]

How to execute
--------------
Simply execute `main.m` in Octave/MATLAB
