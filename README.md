Student Performance Analysis
============================
This is a study on a [Student Performance Data Set][Dataset] based on two Portuguese schools students information.

If you wish a more detail explanation of what were the Machine Learning Strategies used and how, and which conclusions 
were reached you may read the [research paper][Research Paper].

Original Research & Motivation
------------------------------
This technical analysis was based of that [Portuguese researchers original paper][Original Paper], but these time 
with a focus on Machine Learning instead of Business Intelligence.

Dataset
-------
The dataset along a description of the attributes can be downloaded at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository][Dataset]

How to execute
--------------
Simply execute `main.m` in Octave/MATLAB
